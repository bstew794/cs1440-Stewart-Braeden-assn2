I got the program up and working perfectly for UT and DC but it has a few faults in my dictionary so that a wrong output
is displayed for USA_full. will work on issue after committing first version.

I got the program working for the full solution (USA_full / 2018.annual.singlefile.csv) which it is able to do in 13.038
