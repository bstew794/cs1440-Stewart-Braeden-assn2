## O MIGHTY DUCKY GODS HEAR MY PLEA!##
I require some assistance to help my program display the correct values in the report for USA_full. Currently my program
has no issue reporting the current values for UT and DC, but I believe that the problem lies in how I create the
dictionary that stores the desired FIPS codes since I am not looking at the required amount of areas and my program has
the incorrect amount of FIPS areas stored in the dictionary (3438 compared to 3461)

## Expected Behavior

Each subfolder of [data](data) contains a file named `output.txt`.
Your program's output for that dataset should match that file exactly.
