our last project was a great success! The customer was very pleased with their
new Text Tools and so impressed with the quality of my work that they have
decided to contract me to finish the entire project for them.
my task is to analyze a large body of data and produce a report of the
findings.  This program summarizes national employment data collected by the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2018. The report consists of two sections,
a summary across all industries and a summary across the software publishing
industry. My supervisor worked with the customer far enough to develop the format of the
report. It is now my task to analyze a 487MB CSV file to pull out the data
needed by the report.

## Expected Behavior

Each subfolder of [data](data) contains a file named `output.txt`.
Your program's output for that dataset should match that file exactly.
